## Zero Trust Security Framework for Prosumer-Driven Green Energy Certificates  

This paper introduces a **hybrid blockchain-DLT framework** to enhance the trustworthiness and efficiency of green energy certificates (GECs) by decentralizing control to prosumers (producer-consumers) and adopting a zero-trust security model. The solution integrates **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)** with **IOTA’s fee-less Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)** and **Concordium’s public blockchain** to balance operational costs, transparency, and security.  

### Key Components of the Framework  

1. **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI):**  
   - Empowers prosumers to autonomously manage their digital identities and issue certificates as **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**.  
   - Replaces centralized Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) with decentralized, cryptographic trust, eliminating reliance on pre-trusted registries.  

2. **Hybrid DLT-Blockchain Architecture:**  
   - **IOTA Tangle**: Handles high-frequency, fee-less transactions at the prosumer level (e.g., certificate issuance and local registry operations).  
   - **Concordium Blockchain**: Anchors Merkle tree root hashes of certificates in bulk, leveraging its built-in SSI features for immutable, global verification.  

3. **Merkle Tree Structure:**  
   - Certificates are hashed and stored in a Merkle tree, enabling efficient verification.  
   - The root hash of each tree is anchored on Concordium, ensuring data integrity while minimizing blockchain usage (reducing costs).  

4. **Four Core Entities:**  
   - **Prosumer Meters**: Generate and issue GECs as VCs.  
   - **DLT-driven Registries**: Aggregate and validate certificates using IOTA.  
   - **Concordium Blockchain**: Acts as the immutable root of trust.  
   - **Auditors**: Verify certificates via Merkle proofs and blockchain-anchored hashes.  

### How the Framework Works  

#### Certificate Issuance (Steps 1–4):  
1. **Prosumer Meters** generate GECs as SSI-based VCs and send them to registries.  
2. **Registries** validate VCs, build Merkle trees, and anchor root hashes on Concordium.  
3. **Merkle trees** are stored locally on IOTA, with only root hashes committed to the blockchain.  

#### Certificate Verification (Steps 5–6):  
1. **Prosumers** submit certificates and Merkle trees (as Verifiable Presentations, VPs) to auditors.  
2. **Auditors** verify certificates by reconstructing Merkle proofs and cross-checking root hashes on Concordium.  

### Advantages Over Existing Systems  

1. **Decentralized Trust:**  
   - Shifts trust from centralized registries to decentralized prosumers, aligning with zero-trust principles.  

2. **Cost Efficiency:**  
   - IOTA’s fee-less DLT reduces operational costs for high-volume prosumer transactions, while Concordium’s bulk anchoring minimizes blockchain fees.  

3. **Enhanced Security & Transparency:**  
   - SSI ensures tamper-proof identity management, while Merkle trees and blockchain anchoring guarantee certificate integrity.  

4. **Scalability:**  
   - Hybrid architecture supports large-scale prosumer participation without compromising performance.  

5. **Interoperability:**  
   - Combines the strengths of DLT (speed, cost) and blockchain (immutability, SSI) for a flexible, future-proof system.
