Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) serve as proof that a specific amount of electricity has been generated from renewable sources. These certificates enable companies and individuals to track and verify their use of clean energy, contributing to global sustainability efforts.

## Introduction to Energy Attribute Certificates (EAC)

An EAC represents a unit of renewable energy, typically 1 megawatt-hour (MWh), and is issued when that energy is fed into the grid. It helps businesses and consumers claim ownership of renewable energy usage and supports compliance with green energy regulations.

### Key Features of EACs

- **Unique Identification** – Each certificate has a unique ID to prevent duplication.
- **Traceability** – Includes information about the energy source, production date, and location.
- **Tradeability** – Can be bought, sold, or retired in accordance with regulatory requirements.
- **Regulatory Compliance** – Helps organizations meet sustainability goals and carbon neutrality commitments.
