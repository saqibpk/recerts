## Prosumer-Centric Aggregation for Granular Energy Certificates  

This paper introduces a **prosumer-centric aggregation framework** to address the scalability and cost challenges of blockchain-based Granular Certificates (GCs). By leveraging **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)** and hybrid blockchain-DLT architecture, the solution reduces transaction costs while maintaining transparency and decentralization. The framework enables efficient bulk certification of GCs and Decentralized Granular Certificates (DeGCs) through Merkle tree anchoring on public blockchains like Concordium, supported by IOTA's feeless DLT for high-volume transactions.  

### Key Components of the Framework  

1. **Granular Certificates (GCs/DeGCs):**  
   - Track renewable energy production/consumption at intervals as low as 15 minutes, enabling real-time alignment with energy markets.  
   - DeGCs enhance standardization and interoperability through SSI, replacing fragmented regional EAC systems (e.g., RECs, GOs).  

2. **Hybrid Blockchain-DLT Architecture:**  
   - **IOTA Tangle**: Handles high-frequency, feeless transactions for GC/DeGC issuance and local aggregation.  
   - **Concordium Blockchain**: Anchors Merkle tree root hashes for immutable verification, serving as a single source of truth.  

3. **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI):**  
   - Empowers prosumers to manage identities and certificates as **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)** without centralized authorities.  
   - Enables decentralized trust and cross-border trading via standardized SSI protocols.  

4. **Merkle Tree Aggregation:**  
   - Aggregates certificates into hierarchical hash structures, reducing on-chain data requirements.  
   - Root hashes anchored on Concordium ensure data integrity while minimizing blockchain usage.  

### How the Framework Works  

#### Aggregation & Verification Process:  
1. **Certificate Issuance**: Prosumer meters generate GCs/DeGCs as SSI-based VCs and submit them to IOTA-driven registries.  
2. **Bulk Aggregation**: Prosumers or registries aggregate certificates into Merkle trees.  
3. **Re-Certification**: Registries validate aggregated certificates and anchor Merkle roots on Concordium.  
4. **Auditing**: Verifiers check certificates via Merkle proofs and blockchain-anchored data.  

### Advantages Over Existing Systems  

1. **Cost Efficiency:**  
   - Reduces blockchain transaction costs by 90% compared to traditional models (e.g., ETT’s hourly anchoring).  
   - IOTA’s feeless DLT eliminates per-transaction fees for prosumers.  

2. **Decentralized Trust:**  
   - Shifts aggregation from centralized registries to prosumer meters, aligning with zero-trust principles.  
   - SSI ensures tamper-proof identity management and certificate ownership.  

3. **Interoperability:**  
   - Standardizes GCs/DeGCs globally using SSI, enabling cross-registry trading (e.g., EU GOs ↔ US RECs).  

4. **Scalability:**  
   - Supports high-frequency certificate issuance (e.g., 15-minute intervals) without compromising performance.  

### Comparative Analysis with ETT’s Aggregation  

| **Parameter**              | **ETT’s Hybrid Aggregation** | **Proposed Prosumer-Centric Aggregation** |  
|----------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|  
| **Trust Model**             | Centralized registries       | Decentralized prosumer-driven trust       |  
| **Transaction Cost**        | Linear growth with frequency | Exponential cost reduction via bulk anchoring |  
| **Blockchain Usage**         | High (hourly anchoring)      | Low (on-demand anchoring)                 |  
| **Granularity Support**      | 1-hour intervals             | 15-minute to 3-hour intervals             |  

### State of the Art  
- Builds on Energy Track and Trace (ETT) but replaces centralized trust with SSI and DLT.  
- Outperforms NFT/SFT-based solutions by enabling sliceable certificates through SSI.  
- Integrates IOTA’s indexing and local snapshots for efficient certificate retrieval and storage optimization.  

This framework addresses critical challenges in renewable energy certification, offering a scalable, cost-effective, and transparent solution for decentralized energy markets.
