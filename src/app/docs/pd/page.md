## ReCert and Prosumer-Driven Aggregator for Granular Energy Certificates  

This paper introduces **ReCert (Re-Certified Renewable Energy Certificates)** and a **prosumer-driven aggregator** to address the limitations of traditional Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). ReCert enables granular, sliceable certificates for small-scale renewable energy projects (e.g., residential solar panels) and leverages **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)** and **IOTA’s Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)** to ensure transparency, interoperability, and cost efficiency.  

### Key Components of the Framework  

1. **Granular ReCerts:**  
   - Supports certificates in smaller units (e.g., kWh instead of MWh), enabling participation of household prosumers.  
   - Sliceable design allows flexible trading and aggregation.  

2. **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI):**  
   - Empowers prosumers to issue certificates as **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**, ensuring decentralized trust and global verification.  

3. **Hybrid Architecture:**  
   - **IOTA Tangle**: Manages high-volume, feeless transactions for certificate issuance and aggregation.  
   - **Public Blockchain**: Anchors aggregated Merkle Tree root hashes for immutable verification.  

4. **Prosumer-Driven Aggregator:**  
   - Aggregates certificates at the prosumer meter level, reducing reliance on centralized registries.  

5. **Three Core Entities:**  
   - **Prosumer Meters**: Generate and submit granular ReCerts.  
   - **IOTA-Driven Registry**: Validates and aggregates certificates using IOTA’s DLT.  
   - **Auditors**: Verify certificates via Merkle proofs and blockchain-anchored data.  

### How ReCert Works  

#### Certificate Lifecycle:  
1. **Creation**: Prosumer meters generate ReCerts for renewable energy production (e.g., solar panels) and submit them to the IOTA-driven registry.  
2. **Ownership Transfer**: ReCerts are traded globally using SSI standards, enabling cross-registry transactions.  
3. **Retirement**: ReCerts are retired when claimed for Scope 2 emissions, removing them from circulation.  

#### Aggregation Process:  
1. **Submission**: Prosumers submit ReCerts to the IOTA-driven registry.  
2. **Aggregation**: Prosumer meters aggregate ReCerts into a Merkle Tree and request Re-Certification.  
3. **Re-Certification**: The registry verifies aggregated certificates, anchors the Merkle Tree root hash on the blockchain, and updates ownership/status.  
4. **Verification**: Auditors validate certificates using Merkle proofs and blockchain data.  

### Role of IOTA’s DLT  
- **Indexation Payloads**: Enables efficient retrieval of ReCerts using transaction tags.  
- **Feeless Transactions**: Reduces costs for high-volume, granular certificate issuance.  
- **Local Snapshots**: Truncates outdated data to optimize storage and operational efficiency.  

### Advantages Over Existing Systems  

1. **Granularity & Inclusivity**:  
   - Supports small-scale prosumers (e.g., households) by enabling kWh-level certificates.  

2. **Cost Efficiency**:  
   - IOTA’s feeless DLT minimizes transaction costs, while bulk anchoring on blockchain reduces gas fees.  

3. **Decentralized Trust**:  
   - SSI and blockchain eliminate reliance on centralized registries, enhancing transparency.  

4. **Interoperability**:  
   - Standardized VC-based certificates enable cross-registry and cross-border trading.  

5. **Simplified Management**:  
   - Prosumer-driven aggregation reduces Merkle Tree complexity and streamlines auditing.  

### Comparative Benefits  
- **Reduced Merkle Trees**: Aggregates certificates on-demand (vs. periodic aggregation in existing systems).  
- **Lower Operational Costs**: Fewer blockchain transactions due to optimized aggregation.  
- **User-Centric Design**: Each Merkle Tree corresponds to a single prosumer, simplifying audits and ownership transfers.  

This framework addresses the rigidity, centralization, and inefficiencies of traditional RECs, fostering a more inclusive and scalable renewable energy market.
