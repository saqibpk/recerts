## Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and its Role in Standardizing GC

Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a decentralized model for managing and verifying identities where individuals have full control over their own data. Unlike traditional identity systems, where identity information is stored and controlled by third parties (such as governments or corporations), SSI puts the user at the center. With SSI, individuals can issue, store, and share their credentials without the need for a central authority, ensuring greater privacy and security.

### How SSI Can Help in Standardizing GC and Avoid Fragmentation of EAC

In the context of the transition from Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) to Green Certificates (GCs), SSI can provide a solution to avoid fragmentation and ensure consistency. By using a decentralized and standardized SSI framework, it is possible to create a universal identity and credentialing system for GCs, ensuring:

1. **Decentralization**: SSI eliminates the need for a central authority, allowing for greater flexibility and security in issuing and verifying certificates.
2. **Interoperability**: Through standardized protocols and verifiable credentials, SSI can ensure that GCs issued by different entities are universally recognized, minimizing the risk of fragmentation.
3. **User Control**: With SSI, certificate holders can manage and share their credentials securely, ensuring that only valid and verified GCs are used in transactions.
4. **Scalability**: As more entities adopt SSI, the system can scale to accommodate a growing number of certificates without compromising security or privacy.

This decentralized approach can reduce the risks associated with fragmentation during the transition from EAC to GC, ensuring a seamless and standardized process for all stakeholders.
